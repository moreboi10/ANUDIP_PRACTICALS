JVM : converts byte code to machine code

type of memory :
stack = stores primitive data types 
heap = stores non primitive data types


stack => local vars , obj reference
heap => oject , arrays , actual values
w
MDN- refer memory management 

static : does not require obj to call static funtion 
non static : does require obj to call static funtion

string methods: 
ðŸ”¹ Commonly Used String Methods:

question :
Program Question   :Create a Java Singleton class
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of an object to only one instance. To do this, youâ€™ll need to create a Singleton class that has a non-parameterized constructor.

The class should have one public variable called str. It should also have a static method called getSingleInstance thatâ€™ll return the single instanceÂ ofÂ theÂ class

2) Write a phone number word decoder :
Write a program in Java thatâ€™ll accept a phone number with letters and convert it to a phone number with only digits. For example, if you sent the program a phone number like 800888TEST, it should return (800) 8

-switch case

-sub_string
-cocatination
-types of constructor
-this keyword



Inheritance :
mechanism of one class to acquire features of other class . for the purpose of code reusablity , code redundancy is not happening , additional features code maintaince easier to manage

types of Inheritance:
single level Inheritance
multilevel Inheritance





polymorphism :
polymorphism is using same name methods with different parameter to avoid using and remembering too many names 
poly - many 
morph - forms

types:
1 - compile time poly 
2 - run time poly 

codition of compile time poly:
    parameter must differ in :
        * no of methods 
        * type of params
        * order of params
    -> you cannot change the methods by changing the return type alone



run time polymorphism:
    * It is also known as method overriding 
    * It is type of polymorphism where the specific method to be callled is determined at runtime and not at compile time .
    * This is achived through method overriding, 
    -where subclass provides a specific implimentation of method inherited from its parent class.
    * The JVM (java virtual machine) decides which method to execute based on the actuall object type and runtime.
    
    "run time pe decide hoga konsa method call hoga based on input/value"

    rules of method overiding:
        - only possible with inheritance 
        - method must be overridden not overloaded
        - only instance methods are polymorphic (non static & private method)
        --the static method resolved at compile time thats why not possible
        -private or final methods cannot be overridden
        
    benefit:
        - flexibility 
        - loose coupling 
        - scalebility 
        

OOPS remaining : 
* encapsulation 
* abstraction 
* interface 
other things : 
-> final and static keyword 

Abstraction is one of the four pillar of object oriented programing in java .
-> It means hiding internal implimentation details and showing only essential features to the user .
->hide 


* key points : 
    * It hides complex code and show only the necessary parts.
    * Implimentation is done using abstract classes and interface.
    * User only sees whats necessary 
    example:
        driving a car -you use the steering , brake , gear but dont know the internal engine funtion 
    
Why use abstraction:
    * It improves code maintainabilty.
    * Achive loose coupling(dependency )
    * Enchanced security.
    * It encouraged modular programing. 

Properties:
    * An abstract class must be declared with abstract keyword.
    * It can have abstract as well as non abstract methods.
    * It can not be instantiated.
    * It can have constructors and static methods also.
    * It can have final methods .
    * which will force the subclass not to change the body of the methods.
    * jab bhi hum derive class ke constructor ko call karte toh pehle base class constructor call hota hai phir derive ka hota hai .
    * It extends one class only 
    * non-abstract method is also known as concrete methods
    
    Question : Create a java program using abstraction to model a payment system ?
    que.requirements:
        create and abstract class name payment 
        add and abstract method called process payment (double type)
        create two sub_classes :
            credit card payment 
            UPI payment
        Impliment the process_payment method in both sub_classes with custom logic (eg print statements)
        In the main method :
            use abstract class reference to call the method of both payment types (animal d1 = new dog(); reference of animal)


INTERFACE :
    what is and interface in java ?
    ->An interface in java is completely abstract class that is used to group related abstract  methods it defines  what class must do, but not how it does it .

key features :
    * It uses interface keyword.
    * All the methods are public and abstract by default.(till java 7)
    * All the fields(variables) int interface are public static and final by default. 
    * For inherit we use impliments keyword not extends.
    * We can impliment multiple inheritance.
    * for java 8+ it can have default and static methods 
    * interface ke andar koi bhi non static method nhi hona chahiye
    * interface ke construtor nhi ho sakte

    why interface cant have construtor ?
    ->an interface is not a class , its just a contract( blueprint) for what a class should do .
        since interfaces cannot be instantiated ,they dont need constructors.
