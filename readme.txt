Method	                                                             Description
length()	                                                Returns the length of the string.
charAt(int index)	                                        Returns the character at the specified index.
substring(int beginIndex)	                                Returns substring from the given index to end.
substring(int start, int end)	                            Returns substring between two indices.
equals(String s)	                                        Compares two strings (case-sensitive).
equalsIgnoreCase(String s)	                                Compares two strings ignoring case.
compareTo(String s)	                                        Lexicographically compares two strings.
toLowerCase()	                                            Converts all characters to lowercase.
toUpperCase()	                                            Converts all characters to uppercase.
trim()	Removes                                             leading and trailing whitespaces.
replace(char old, char new)	                                Replaces all occurrences of a character.
contains(CharSequence s)	                                Checks if string contains a sequence.
startsWith(String prefix)	                                Checks if string starts with given prefix.
endsWith(String suffix)	                                    Checks if string ends with given suffix.
indexOf(char ch)	                                        Returns index of first occurrence of character.
lastIndexOf(char ch)	                                    Returns index of last occurrence.
isEmpty()	                                                Checks if string is empty.
split(String regex)	                                        Splits the string around matches of the regex.

question :
Program Question   :Create a Java Singleton class
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of an object to only one instance. To do this, youâ€™ll need to create a Singleton class that has a non-parameterized constructor.

The class should have one public variable called str. It should also have a static method called getSingleInstance thatâ€™ll return the single instanceÂ ofÂ theÂ class

2) Write a phone number word decoder :
Write a program in Java thatâ€™ll accept a phone number with letters and convert it to a phone number with only digits. For example, if you sent the program a phone number like 800888TEST, it should return (800) 8

Inheritance :
mechanism of one class to acquire features of other class . for the purpose of code reusablity , code redundancy is not happening , additional features code maintaince easier to manage

types of Inheritance:
single level Inheritance
multilevel Inheritance
